# pamparam
A binance api wrapper that generates signals for every coin using ta and flask.

# v0.1
Only stochrsi signals are generated and there is just one page. Some unusable exchanges are shown too, and shown exchanges are limited to USDT fiat. New features will be added in the future.

Just download or clone the code, start a venv, dowload the requirements, and use "flask run" in the cli.
